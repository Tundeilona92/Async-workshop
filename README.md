You will learn on this workshop:

- What are Promises, how they are working?

## Setting up the repo

- Make sure that the [Live Server VS code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is installed.

## Async Demo

Why we need async code execution in Javascript?

- Start the live server.
- Open the `http://localhost:5500/demo`
- Check the responseiveness of the page:
  - Try out the on/off button.
  - Scroll the text.
  - Hover the buttons. 
- Click on the blocking button
  - check the responsivness again.
  - after the browser's unresponsive alert is shown, click to reload.
- Click the non blocking button
  - check the responsiveness again

## Tasks

- The tasks are in js files, `task<n>.js`.
- Each js file contains the task's description.
- You can run the task with the `node task<n>.js` command for testing.
