import { getRandomNumberSlowly } from "./promises.js";

/*
  - Create a function that generates 3 random number. Log this 3 numbers to the console.
  - This time use only the getRandomNumberSlowly() function.
  - Run the promises concurrently with the Promise.all() or Promise.allSettled() functions.
  - You can choose between the then and the async await syntax.

  Goal: Concurrent promise execution.
  Questions:
    - What is the difference between the sequential and the concurrent execution of the promises?
    - When starting the Promise operation?
    - What is the difference between Promise.all() and Promise.allSettled()?
