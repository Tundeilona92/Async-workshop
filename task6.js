import { sleep } from "./promises.js";

/*
  - Create a function that waits 2 seconds, then logs "Step 1" to the console.
  - Then waits 2 seconds more and logs "Step 2" to the console.
  - Use the sleep() function.
  - Use the `then syntax`

  Goal: Chain Promises sequentially.
  Questions:
    - What will be happened, if I return a Promise from the then method's 
      callback function?
